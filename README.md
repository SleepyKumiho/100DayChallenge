## Projects

## Daily Log
Day 1: Going over the basics of using CSS to personalize a webpage  <br>
Day 2: Learned about the how to combine selectors in CSS in order to increase specificity or increase range and thus limit repetition <br>
Day 3: Played a CSS selector game to solidify knowledge from yesterday (https://css-diner.netlify.app/) <br>
Day 4: Played with some machine learning models to watch how the judgement process works at a superficial level, and practiced CSS rules for changing qualities of text and images. <br>
Day 5: Practiced using the box model to manipulate the size of divs. Also learned about the different sizing methods available in css (px, em, rem, VH, VW) <br>
Day 6: Learned about the critical render path and online resources for minifying CSS code for faster transfers. Also implemented flexbox styles for images, and solidified understanding through an interactive project. <br>
Day 7: Added transform and transition elements to the previously created flexbox testing webpage. <br>
Day 8: Introduction to bootstrap, learned about how to link bootstrap with the CDN and how it can streamline element addition to websites. <br>
Day 9: Covered the introduction to machine learning and data science bootcamp, no coding exercises have been completed today. <br>
Day 10: Completed initial steps in the Startup Launch Page exercise, adding the basic elements and styles. <br>
Day 11: Completed layout organization for the Startup Launch Page exercise. Also learned to use github to upload a website publicly. <br>
Day 12: Downloaded conda and started a practice environment and a jupyter notebook. <br>
Day 13: Completed a Jupyter Notebook Tutorial to learn about the system of cells and the various keyboard shortcuts available. <br>
Day 14: Going through the Pandas tutorial, learning about commands that allow for basic visualizations of data. <br>
Day 15: Completed Pandas tutorial exercises. Began numpy tutorial, learned about the mechanism behind dot product and other mathematical functions available for matrices, and their differences. Also practiced using comparisons and reshaping and transposing matrices for calculation purposes. <br>
Day 16: Completed Numpy exercises. <br>
Day 17: Began matplotlib tutorial, learned how to start simple plots and began customizing the type of plot and the labels that help make plots useful at a glance. <br>
Day 18: Continued matplotlib tutorial, practicing using pandas dataframes to create plots. <br>
Day 19: Completed matplotlib tutorial, customizing figure colors and styles, and completed matplotlib exercise set. <br?
Day 20: Began Scikit=Learn tutorial, going over a basic workflow and exploring a cheatsheet style notebook. <br>
Day 21: Continued Scikit-learn tutorial, reviewed basic statistical methods like data splits needed for initating a model. <br>
Day 22: Continued scikit-learn tutorial. <br>
Day 23: Followed an example of a full sciekit-learn use case, creating, training, and analyzing a random forest model. <br>
Day 24: Learned about how to update and remove certain packages in conda to deal with certain version based warnings and started going more in depth into transforming data before using it in a model. <br>
Day 25: Practiced using OneHotEncoder to transform categorical data into a binary matrix that is usable for models. <br>
Day 26: Learned to use Pandas .filna() and Scikit Learn imputers in order to transform and fill missing data. <br>
Day 27: Looked through the Scikit Learn model map and pracitcing using different regression models and comparing the results using California housing data. <br>
Day 28: Testing models for regression predictions. <br>
Day 29: Testing Scikit learn models for classification predictions. <br>
Day 30: Learning more about how to fit Scikit learn models with data. <br>
Day 31: Learning more about using models to create predictions and interpreting results. <br>
Day 32: Used predict_proba() to look at classification probabilities and compared to a predict() prediction on the same dataset. <br>
Day 33: Learning about the different ways to evaluate Scikit-Learn models (so far score() and cross validation) <br>
Day 34: Learned about what calculations are used behind the scenes when using score() on regression versus classification models. <br>
Day 35: Compared the results of accuracy (cross validation) and an ROC curve on classification data. <br>
Day 36: Learned about the use of confusion matrices and classification reports as methods to analuze classification models. <br>
Day 37: Practiced using the r2_score function to analyze regression models. <br>
Day 38: Learned about using mean absolute error and mean squared error as other methods to evaluate the results of a regression model. <br>
Day 39: Used cross_val_score and looked through the different options for the "scoring" parameter. <br>
Day 40: Practicing using the direct metrics functions from sklearn to collect evaluation data of classification and regression data. <br>
Day 41: Overview of huperparameters. <br>
Day 42: Used GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV to test different huperparameter combinations without manually adjusting the values.
